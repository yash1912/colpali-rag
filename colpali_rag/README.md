# üß† ColPali-Powered RAG: Unlocking Knowledge from PDFs with Advanced AI Models

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **ColPali-Powered RAG**, an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution leveraging cutting-edge AI models like ColPali and Qwen2VL. This project is designed to extract, index, and retrieve information from PDFs, combining the power of natural language processing and image processing. It's like having your own AI librarian‚Äîhelping you quickly find key information from a stack of documents! üìöü§ñ

> **‚ú® Why This Project?**  
> If you are anything like and were working on PDF files for GenAI applications. You know how tedious and difficult it is to do OCR on PDF files especially while mantaining the structure of the text (at least for the unpaid solutions). Sifting through PDFs for valuable information can be tedious. ColPali RAG simplifies this by transforming how you interact with documents. This project highlights an innovative approach to bridging the gap between AI-powered retrieval and content understanding.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered PDF Indexing:** Seamlessly converts PDFs into searchable embeddings using ColPali's AI model.
- **Intelligent Retrieval:** Asks questions and receives image-based and textual responses using Qwen2VL's advanced capabilities.
- **Scalable:** Handles large batches of documents while efficiently managing GPU resources.
- **Memory-Efficient:** Utilizes GPU memory clearing techniques to ensure smooth processing for complex queries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Torch:** For model loading and inference.
- **LangChain:** Powers conversation memory for chat interactions.
- **Chainlit:** Enhances interactivity for model responses.
- **PDF2Image:** Converts PDFs into images for easy indexing.
- **Transformers:** Implements advanced NLP and computer vision models.

## üìã How It Works

1. **PDF Upload:** Upload PDF files through the interface.
2. **Indexing:** The ColPali model processes each page to generate searchable embeddings.
3. **Query:** Ask any question related to the indexed PDFs.
4. **Retrieval:** The model retrieves the most relevant pages, processing them to provide both textual and image-based responses.
5. **AI Chat:** Interact with the AI, getting more context-aware responses through the Qwen2VL model.

## ü§ñ Model Details

- **ColPali Model:** Utilizes ColPali's state-of-the-art vision and language capabilities for processing PDF content.
- **Qwen2VL:** Adds an extra layer of intelligence to interpret user queries and retrieve the most relevant information.

>ColPali is a visual retrieval model based on Vision Language Models (VLMs) that efficiently indexes documents through their visual features. It extends the PaliGemma-3B model to generate multi-vector representations for text and images. This model uses image patch embeddings processed through a language model, mapping them to a latent space similar to textual input. By applying the ColBERT strategy, it enhances interaction between text tokens and image patches, improving performance.

## üß© Customization

- **Model Fine-Tuning:** You can swap the base models with any compatible `transformers` model by modifying the `model_name` parameters in `colpali_rag.py`.
- **Storage Backends:** Adapt the code to store indexed embeddings in a database for larger-scale applications.

## üõ°Ô∏è Handling Errors

The code includes error handling for PDF processing and GPU memory management. For further troubleshooting, check out the comments in `colpali_rag.py` and `app.py`.


## üî• Future Enhancements

- **Web Interface:** Build a full-fledged web interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Distributed Processing:** Enable multi-GPU support for handling extremely large datasets.
